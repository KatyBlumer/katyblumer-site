I'm a fifth-year PhD student in computer science at Cornell University, advised by Jon Kleinberg. I am broadly interested in extracting patterns from complex data. This includes both long-term user trajectories on social media, and understanding and interpreting machine learning predictions.


Previously, I worked at Google Health on machine learning for detecting disease and other novel signals in retina images,
after graduating with a BS in Physics from NYU Abu Dhabi. I also interned at Google Accelerated Science in 2020.
